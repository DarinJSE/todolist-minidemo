# Mini Project Series: Simple Todo-list 
(exercising, not for portofolio, gotta stay active twinâœŒðŸ¥€ðŸ’”)
This project is just demonstration for my laerning progress in web development, especially front-end, nothing special, just regular todo-list.

feature:
- Add task, checklist, delete, that's it.

Gonna add some cool features soon, of course i'll fix the UI, i know it's ugly as hell, atleast is still on WCAG.
